ðŸ“Š Week 2 Progress (60%)

In this week, we focus on project evaluation, data splitting, model training, testing, and visualization of results.

Feature Engineering

Handling categorical variables (e.g., soil types, crop categories).

Creating new features (e.g., rainfall-to-crop-yield ratio).

Feature scaling and normalization for better model performance.



---

Data Splitting

Splitting the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

Ensuring stratified sampling for balanced representation of crops and regions.



---

Model Training

Training multiple machine learning models:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Support Vector Machines (SVM)


Initial experiments with deep learning models for time-series yield prediction.



---

Model Testing & Evaluation

Performance metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, RMSE


Comparison of models to find the best-performing one.



---

Visualization

Yield prediction trends over time.

Actual vs Predicted yield plots.

Feature importance graphs.

Regional performance heatmaps.
